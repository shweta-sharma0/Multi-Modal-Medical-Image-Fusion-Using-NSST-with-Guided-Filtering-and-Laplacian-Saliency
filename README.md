# Multi-Modal-Medical-Image-Fusion-Using-NSST-with-Guided-Filtering-and-Laplacian-Saliency

This repository provides code and datasets for a novel medical image fusion framework based on the Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST). The system refines low-frequency components using guided filtering and applies Laplacian-based saliency for high-frequency  and low-frequency fusion, achieving superior detail preservation and structural fidelity in multimodal medical images.

##  Features

- Four-level NSST decomposition for enhanced multiscale directional representation.
- Guided filtering to smooth and preserve structural integrity in low-frequency subbands.
- Saliency-driven weight maps combining Laplacian contrast, entropy, and directional measures for high-frequency and low-frequency fusion.
